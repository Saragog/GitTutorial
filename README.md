Some more practice with github
Some text written in readme just in order to make some practice with github working on branches
I do not know what else to write so I write this. I like sushi a lot.
Some more text
Like playing with dogs, partying, learning languages, speaking with people, programming, watching films and
first of all I love listening to music while I code :)
